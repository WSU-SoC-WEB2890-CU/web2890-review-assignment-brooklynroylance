TODO: List here all the changes you made to given template to adapt it to your needs

1) Adjusted navigation to include my new sections and remove the telephone button.
2) Changed Portfolio img object-fit to cover so that the images are cropped instead of distorted.

4) Added gradient to primary buttons when hovered to emphasize the change.
5) Added the id to the nav links to make them work with each of the sections.
6) Turned the portfolio boxes into buttons to make the projects more interactive.
7) Created modals for the portfolio boxes buttons so that the user can view the full images.
8) Removed the extra portfolio boxes because I didn't have projects to put in them.
